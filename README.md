## For Deliverable 1 we need to:
## - Propose project topic
## - Identify main data management needs
## - Explore potential complex queries
## - Analyze user functionality
1. Quality of the overview and description of the application. A reader of Project Deliverable
1 is not familiar with the application a group has in mind. Therefore, it is the group’s task to
provide a detailed description of the application so that the reader has a chance to
understand it. Therefore, this description should be written from a reader’s perspective and
not from the group’s perspective that already has full knowledge of the project. The group
members should ask themselves what should be described so that the reader has a chance to
understand the application.
2. Quality of the motivation of the database needs of the application and the potential user
interest in the application. A first question a group should answer to themselves and to the
reader is why and how their application would benefit from database support and complex
trend queries. Not every application requires database support. A second question is who
the users of the application are and what their interests in the group’s application are.
3. Quality of the description of the needed web-based user interface functionality. The
CIS 4301 UF Online Group Project Specification − 12 − Spring 2024
web-based user interface provides support for input and output. Input refers to the possible
user interactions and data input. Output refers to the graphical presentation of trend query
results. The question is what the requirements of user input and graphical output are
regarding the group’s application.
4. Quality of the description of the application goals regarding trend analysis. Trend analysis
by means of complex trend queries is the overall topic of the database project. The question
is what the group’s goals and planned achievements regarding trend analysis are.
5. Quality of the description of the real-word data forming the basis of the application and
the complex trend queries. Finding real-world data that supports the group’s application
and enables the formulation and execution of complex trend queries is one of the main
steps of the project. The real-world data sources must be described in a manner that both
the group and a reader of Project Deliverable 1 can understand their nature, properties, and
weaknesses and make an assessment about their suitability for trend analysis.
6. Quality of five colloquial complex trend queries and their explanation. Five different
colloquial queries (not copies!) that represent trend queries must be listed (at least) and
described in detail. A trend query can be recognized by the fact that (i) the graphical
visualization of its result is a diagram with a time unit at its x-axis and a numerical unit at
its y-axis, (ii) the trend is represented as a smooth curve, and (iii) each (time, number)-pair
of the trend curve is a computed value.
7. Quality of the description of the intended use of public domain and/or proprietary
software. Each group should already begin to determine the software to be used in the
implementation phase of the project. This choice can be changed at any time later if the
group decides this. But this enables the group to learn the missing software components
(e.g., a web-based programming language) until the actual implementation phase begins.
